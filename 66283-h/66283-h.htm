<h1>The Disembodied Man</h1>

<h2>By Larry Maddock</h2>

<p>George remembered riding on the El with<br />
the sad girl across from him. Then there was<br />
nothing&mdash;nothing but blackness, and a voice....</p>

<p><i>This, he thought, is a crazy way to die.</i></p>

<p>"<i>You're not dying, George. You're just beginning to live.</i>"</p>

<p><i>He started, tried to see her. I didn't say anything!</i></p>

<p><i>"Yes you did," she insisted, in that same low voice. "You said, 'This
is a crazy way to die.'"</i></p>

<p><i>George tried to prop himself up on his elbows&mdash;but suddenly he
realized that he had no elbows!</i></p>

<p><i>"Don't worry, George. Just rest. You'll be all right."</i></p>

<p><i>How&mdash;where am I?</i></p>

<p><i>"Just rest," she repeated, and then she was gone. George thought about
her for a long time, before dropping off to sleep.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a cold night, and lonely, for George Jameson. He paced the floor
of his apartment, back and forth, into the kitchen, into the hall,
through the bedroom, back and forth.</p>

<p>"God!" he said, although there was no one there to hear him. "Two
years! And where am I?"</p>

<p>Angrily, he reached for his coat. Maybe some fresh air would do him
good. He buttoned the coat, fumbled for his overcoat.</p>

<p>Then he walked outdoors.</p>

<p>It was snowing. The clean, white, slippery kind of snow that stays
for a while, then quickly turns into Chicago slush. Instinctively,
he turned his collar up against the cold, and headed for the El, a
sentimental relic of the 20th century just past.</p>

<p>The snow was coming down in big, lazy flakes that caught themselves in
the wind and buffeted against his overcoat. Streetlights cast weird
shadows across the white. George could hear the faint <i>crunch-crunch</i>
his shoes made. Half-turning he looked at his tracks behind him.</p>

<p>"Damn white stuff!" He hunched his shoulders more, pulled his neck down
into the folds of his collar. "Puts a pure clean blanket over the whole
world&mdash;but all you have to do is walk on it and you can see the dirt
underneath!"</p>

<p>George climbed the steps to the elevated, bought a ticket to anywhere.
Then he sat down and waited for a train.</p>

<p>There was a girl waiting with him. She was pretty. George watched her
until the train pulled in, wondering what she was doing wandering
around Chicago at this time of night.</p>

<p>She got on the train with him, sat down in the seat across from him.
The train whined into motion.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said after a while.</p>

<p>"Hello," he replied, startled by her voice. <i>People on elevated trains
don't go around saying "hello" to each other!</i></p>

<p>"Do you mind awfully much if I talk to you?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead." <i>Nor</i>, he thought, <i>do they ask such questions of strange
men.</i></p>

<p>"Do you ever get lonely here in Chicago?"</p>

<p>George smiled. "Sometimes," he said. "You lonely, kid?"</p>

<p>"Awfully. I like to talk to strangers. Then I don't feel quite so
lonely."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>She was quiet for a minute, her eyes friendly, but her trim body stiff
against the city.</p>

<p>"Don't let the town get you down, kid." He was giving <i>her</i> advice!</p>

<p>She looked at him wistfully. "Maybe it's not so bad. Only the people
who are fitted to live in a world like this keep on living. There are a
lot of people who don't see it the way we do."</p>

<p>"Could be." She was a strange girl, he thought, to be talking this way.
Young, pretty, and fed up already. "Why do you ride the El at night?"
he asked.</p>

<p>She smiled. "I can meet people&mdash;other lonely people&mdash;who don't know me
and don't want to pry. I can talk to people, and learn things. And then
I never see them again. I can't talk to people in a crowd."</p>

<p>Through the windows he could see the lights of a sleeping city flash by
like speeding fireflies. "Never thought of it that way," he said.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning, the hurtling elevated car leaped under
him. He was thrown to the floor as the car jumped the tracks and
twisted upon itself. George saw the lights go off and heard the girl
scream&mdash;and then her scream was cut off, sharply, by the grinding,
tearing crunch of impact.</p>

<p>Blackness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Good morning, George. Did sleep well?"</p>

<p>There she was again&mdash;that soft, quiet voice! <i>Sleep? I don't know if I
did or not. Is it morning?</i></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a beautiful morning." Her voice was like lilacs, George thought.
Sweet, soft lilacs.</p>

<p>"Lilacs? Thank you, George."</p>

<p><i>Go away! I don't want you to hear my thinking.</i></p>

<p>"Then don't sub-vocalize. Don't worry, you'll soon get the hang of it.
Just think without trying to move your tongue and your lips, and I
can't hear you."</p>

<p><i>Where am I?</i></p>

<p>"You're in a hospital." Her voice was gentle, soft.</p>

<p><i>And you?</i></p>

<p>"I'm Karen&mdash;your nurse, George."</p>

<p><i>How bad am I? I mean&mdash;I remember being on an elevated train when it
crashed.</i></p>

<p>"You're going to be all right. The doctors will have you all put back
together again. You just need some new parts."</p>

<p><i>It was that bad, huh?</i></p>

<p>"You almost died. But you're alive now. Please get well, George."</p>

<p><i>What kind of shape am I in?</i></p>

<p>She didn't answer immediately. "How do you feel?"</p>

<p><i>I&mdash;I don't feel! What's the matter&mdash;! I can't feel my body! I&mdash;Where
is my body!</i></p>

<p>"George, please try to understand. You're safe, you're alive. You're
not crazy, and this isn't a nightmare...."</p>

<p><i>Where is my body?</i> He tried to scream it, but no sound came.</p>

<p>"Please, listen to me. You're in a hospital. You're being kept alive
by the best doctors we have, and by machines made by those doctors.
Physically, there isn't much left of you, but we're going to give you a
new body. Please be patient. And please co-operate."</p>

<p>The thought was staggering. New body! <i>Then all that's left of me is</i>&mdash;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">

<hr class="chap" />

<p>She finished it for him. "A brain in a jar, kept alive by pumps and
blood-conditioners and electronic impulses. I'm here to try to keep you
sane."</p>

<p>George was silent, thinking now in visual images instead of words. A
brain in a glass jar, surrounded by fantastic machinery to perform the
functions of the human body. And a woman's voice being piped in to him,
to keep him from going mad. He'd read about it somewhere&mdash;that it had
been tried, and was successful up to a point. But the patient had died.
He didn't want to die.</p>

<p><i>I'll try</i>, he thought loudly. <i>I'll try like hell!</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>George Jameson, or the part of him that was in the jar, learned
quickly. It was two days before he had thoroughly mastered the knack of
thinking to himself, and sub-vocalizing only to others. On the third
day he asked Karen for a description of his surroundings.</p>

<p>"You're in a glass jar, about the size and shape of a normal human
skull case. Leading in through the sides of the glass are several
plastic tubes, a jumble of wires, and a thermometer. Attached to all of
this is about a hundred pounds of machinery, gauges, and such."</p>

<p><i>I must be quite a handsome cuss.</i></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she laughed. "Quite colorful, in fact. With those
chrome-plated fixtures, you cut quite a figure."</p>

<p><i>You're talking to me, Karen, and you can't hear me. Tell me, is this
being broadcast all over the place, or is it strictly a personal
conversation?</i></p>

<p>"George," she said, "you're somewhat of a novelty. The electrodes that
pick up your tiny nerve impulses&mdash;the sub-vocalization&mdash;feed the signal
into a computer-translator sort of thing that changes it into words.
Your voice is purely mechanical. It comes through earphones from the
translator. Of course, everything we say is automatically recorded."</p>

<p><i>Is what I think&mdash;to myself, that is&mdash;is that recorded, too?</i></p>

<p>"No." Her voice had that same gentle, understanding quality. "We
respect your privacy."</p>

<p><i>Thanks. I don't guess there would be much I could do about it if you
didn't, though.</i></p>

<p>"I'm proud of you, George. You're taking all this quite calmly."</p>

<p><i>What have I got to gain by getting excited?</i></p>

<p>He could almost hear her smile. "Nothing."</p>

<p><i>Karen.</i></p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><i>You said something the other day that made me wonder. You said,
"Please get well." What did you mean by that?</i></p>

<p>She hesitated for perhaps a fraction of a second. "Professional pride,
I guess. And maybe it was just the thing to say."</p>

<p><i>Oh.</i> He was silent for a while. <i>Then these experiments haven't worked
out too well in the past.</i> It was more of a statement than a question.</p>

<p>He thought he detected a tightness in her voice. "George, you might
as well know. You're the first man to have ever progressed this far
without going hopelessly insane."</p>

<p><i>It's nice to know I'm not hopeless.</i></p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p><i>I'm sorry, Karen. Maybe I talk too much.</i></p>

<p>"Would you like to hear some music?" Her voice was normal again,
soothing.</p>

<p><i>That would be nice. As long as it's relaxing. Something by Debussy, or
Beethoven, maybe. And please, Karen, accept my apologies for mouthing
off like that.</i></p>

<p>She laughed, softly. "We seem to be forgetting. <i>You're</i> supposed to
be the patient. Will you settle for Gershwin while I go hunt up some
classical stuff?"</p>

<p><i>Gladly, sweetheart. Play it softly, huh?</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Karen.</i></p>

<p>"Yes, George."</p>

<p><i>You know more than I do what it's best for a patient to learn. Can you
tell me all about the setup here?</i></p>

<p>"Just what is it you want to know?"</p>

<p><i>My body&mdash;I mean my new body. How do they build a human body?</i></p>

<p>She laughed softly. "They don't," she said. "Medical science can do
many things, George, but they can't really <i>build</i> a body."</p>

<p><i>But you said</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"They can grow one to order, almost. You know what cancer is, don't
you?"</p>

<p><i>Yes.</i></p>

<p>"Well, the doctors here use what they sometimes call 'controlled
cancer'&mdash;to grow the human body. That way, they can do in months what
it takes Nature years to accomplish."</p>

<p>George puzzled over this for a moment. If he had had eyebrows, there
would have been a frown on his face. If he had a face.</p>

<p><i>You mean&mdash;some other human being gives up his brain to make room for
me?</i></p>

<p>"No, George. It doesn't have a brain. It's just a body, with a small
lump at the top of the spinal cord that controls the muscles." Her
voice was patient, yet urgent. He had to understand. "You see," she
continued, "because of the enormous rate of growth of the rest of the
body, the brain&mdash;or the mind&mdash;doesn't have a chance to develop. The
body has no personality&mdash;no <i>being</i> of its own. It's your body, George.
Yours alone."</p>

<p>He was silent for a long time, thinking. Considering the possibilities
of a new body. It'll be mine, he told himself, all mine. To taste and
hear and feel and smell. To get cold, or warm&mdash;to sweat! To walk, to
swim, to touch her hand&mdash;to see her&mdash;to see Karen! To see Karen, who is
just a voice; to take her dancing! <i>How soon can I be in this body?</i></p>

<p>"It'll be six months, anyway, George." Her voice seemed to be saying,
"Please be patient," just by the tone of it.</p>

<p><i>Six months! Cooped up in this&mdash;this fishbowl!&mdash;for six months more?</i></p>

<p>"I'm sorry, George. You won't be alone, though&mdash;I'll stay with you.
That is, if you want me."</p>

<p>He began to laugh. He laughed uproariously. He didn't care that the
translator made his laugh into a horrible thing that grated in her
ears. Part of the time his laugh was a sob, but it was all the same to
the translator.</p>

<p><i>Do you mind if I call you Mom?</i> There was a catch in his voice. <i>When
I was a kid I used to rely on my mother like this! I've never been so
dependent upon another woman in all my life! If I want you! I need you,
Karen. Don't leave me!</i></p>

<p>"I won't leave you, George&mdash;" He had the feeling there was something
else she wanted to say, but she didn't.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He could hear her voice faintly now. She wasn't talking to him, and he
had to strain to catch her words.</p>

<p>"He's all right, doctor. For the past few days all he's wanted to talk
about is his body. I've been telling him anything he wants to know."</p>

<p>George could barely make out a mumbled answer. It was too far away to
hear the words.</p>

<p>"Play the tape, doctor. You'll see what I mean."</p>

<p>He mustn't let her know he had overheard. He had forgotten all about
this being put on tape. He'd have to watch his words from now on. She
must have thought she had turned the microphone off when the doctor
came in. Mentally, George smiled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Karen.</i></p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p><i>Karen!</i></p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p><i>Karen, can you hear me?</i></p>

<p>Where in the name of heaven did that woman go? Has she left me? Maybe
they gave me up for dead.</p>

<p><i>Karen.</i> I've been sleeping&mdash;or day-dreaming. Or maybe it's the middle
of the night. Maybe she's asleep. Maybe she's gone.</p>

<p><i>Karen!</i> She must be asleep. Or maybe she's dead. Or maybe there's a
loose connection in the wiring.</p>

<p><i>Karen!</i> No answer. Nothing but that deep, dead silence. <i>Karen!
Testing. Testing. One, two, three&mdash;Testing. Karen. Where are you? Can
you hear me, Karen? Karen!</i></p>

<p>It seemed like several eternities before she answered.</p>

<p>"George?"</p>

<p>He would have breathed a sigh of relief, if he could.</p>

<p><i>I thought you'd deserted me. Were you asleep?</i></p>

<p>She laughed that soft, vibrant laugh. "I'm sorry. I just&mdash;stepped out."</p>

<p><i>That's okay, sweetheart. I'm all right. Forget it. But tell me about
these things next time, huh? I worry about you when you're gone.</i></p>

<p>"You shouldn't. I'm a big girl now."</p>

<p><i>Hey! Is this being recorded?</i></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p><i>Who listens to it?</i></p>

<p>"Oh, a bunch of doctors and medical students."</p>

<p><i>Any prudes in the audience?</i></p>

<p>"Not me," she laughed. "But there's bound to be at least <i>one</i>, anyway."</p>

<p><i>Okay</i>, he said. He spent the next two hours telling bawdy stories.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A month later George knew he had grown to rely on Karen more and more.</p>

<p>In fact, he knew he was falling in love with her.</p>

<p>"Hi," she announced. Her voice sounded excited. "George, I just had a
look at your body. It's coming along fine&mdash;in fact, it's bee-ootiful!
I'll be with you in about ten minutes. Enjoy some music while I'm gone.
Bye!"</p>

<p>Then the music lanced into his brain at a tremendous volume. George
quivered in real pain as each note blared forth. It was the loudest
version of the Warsaw Concerto he ever hoped to hear. As the music
progressed, blatting its way through painful crescendos and screaming
treble notes, he tried to shut out the sound of it. It was impossible.
It was a tearing, screeching nightmare of sound, that put him back on
a hurtling elevated train with the sound of a young girl's scream in
his ears, and the pain of a body crushed beyond recognition. With a
convulsive shudder, George was unconscious.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Headache gone yet?" She was concerned.</p>

<p><i>Yeah, sweetheart. I'd like to wring your lovely neck, though.</i></p>

<p>"I'm sorry about the music, George. I didn't have the volume adjusted.
I won't leave you alone again." There was a note in her voice that
George hoped was more than just professional concern.</p>

<p><i>Karen! You don't have to do that! You'll be tying yourself down. And I
don't want that.</i></p>

<p>"I don't mind, George. I just don't want anything to happen to you.
You're something&mdash;someone special."</p>

<p><i>Maybe I don't want it that way. Although I will admit I enjoy your
company&mdash;but this around the clock business isn't necessary.</i></p>

<p>"I want to do it. Okay?"</p>

<p><i>Okay. I guess I can't stop you. Only don't you ever get tired?</i></p>

<p>"Sometimes."</p>

<p><i>Maybe you should let me worry about your welfare for a change. I think
you need some sleep. Lie down a little while.</i></p>

<p>"Sure, boss. Is that an order?"</p>

<p><i>It's an order.</i></p>

<p>"I guess I am a little sleepy. Want some music?"</p>

<p>George shuddered. <i>No! No more records for a long, long time! But leave
your microphone on&mdash;I like to know that you're there.</i></p>

<p>While she slept, he carefully kept his thoughts to himself. She's
sleeping the sleep of the exhausted. The little nut, she probably
didn't go to bed at all while I was&mdash;out. She deserves all the rest she
can get.</p>

<p>He listened a long time to her quiet breathing. I wonder what she
looks like? Is the rest of her as beautiful as her voice? I can't help
it&mdash;I'm in love with her. I wish I was more than a brain in a bottle. I
wish I could touch her&mdash;hold her hand. Silly thought. Like a kid on his
first date.</p>

<p>He pictured her in his mind&mdash;lovely, vibrant, beautiful. How, he
thought savagely, could she ever fall in love with me? Simple&mdash;she
couldn't. No woman could love a freak. And I wouldn't want it that way.
She'd be throwing her happiness away.</p>

<p>But damn it!&mdash;I can't help it if I want her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>I'm neck deep&mdash;if I may be permitted to use such an expression&mdash;in
world affairs. The good doctor read six newspapers to me while you were
gone.</i></p>

<p>Karen laughed. "I thought he sounded a bit hoarse."</p>

<p><i>Well&mdash;out with it, woman! Did you enjoy your first day off in almost
three weeks?</i></p>

<p>Her voice was happier than he had heard it in days. "I went shopping,
George, for the first time in months, and really splurged. Got a new
outfit. You should see me."</p>

<p><i>I wish I could.</i></p>

<p>"You will soon enough."</p>

<p><i>What do you mean by that?</i></p>

<p>"Your body's ready. You move in tomorrow."</p>

<p><i>Thank God! Tomorrow! It is&mdash;rather hard to believe, after all this
time! I'm going to have a body.</i> He could almost feel a lump form in
his throat, only of course he didn't have a throat&mdash;yet. <i>I don't know
if I'm going to like having to put up with the pains of the flesh
again.</i></p>

<p>She laughed. Then her voice turned wistful, or maybe it was just his
imagination. "Not only the pains, George, but the pleasures, too."</p>

<p><i>Yeah.</i> He was silent for a moment. Then he forced his voice to be
light. <i>I can't wait for those eyes, Karen. Tell me about the outfit.
What color is it&mdash;how does the cloth feel? Tell me all about it, Karen.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day, Karen warned him just before Dr. Chase released the
sedative into his blood supply. George peacefully went into a deep,
dreamless sleep. In his mind, he could still hear Karen's voice
speaking gently to him, assuringly.</p>

<p>Almost instantly, it seemed, he was awake, though it took hours. The
first thing he was conscious of was a dull throbbing pain in his
head&mdash;and then he realized&mdash;<i>it was in his head</i>!</p>

<p>Vaguely at first, then sharply, as nerves clicked into action, he could
sense his arms and legs.</p>

<p>He tried moving them, experimentally. It was a painful process.</p>

<p>There was sound, he realized suddenly&mdash;a low, subdued noise level. But
there was no <i>light</i>!</p>

<p><i>Karen! Karen!</i> he thought sharply.</p>

<p>Still just that low noise level. An electric fan going somewhere.</p>

<p><i>Karen!</i> This time he felt the muscles of his throat contract. His
breath came out in a sigh of satisfaction. He had been sub-vocalizing
through long habit!</p>

<p>"Karen." He said it; he heard his voice.</p>

<p>"George! You made it!" Karen was there.</p>

<p>"Karen," he said again. A little quavering, but it was a voice.
"Karen!" he sobbed. "I can't see!"</p>

<p>"Silly!" she laughed. "Of course not&mdash;there's a bandage over your
eyes. The optic nerve is very delicate. The doctors have to give the
nerve-endings&mdash;the nerve-graft&mdash;more time to heal. Another three days
and you'll be able to see."</p>

<p>A low moan from his throat. "Then," he said, haltingly, "you're still
only a voice."</p>

<p>"Not quite," she said. She touched his cheek. Cool, soft fingers. "That
better? Now you're the one who needs some sleep."</p>

<p>"Karen," he said.</p>

<p>Silently, she took his hand in hers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At noon of the fourth day, they removed the bandages from his eyes.</p>

<p>The blinds were drawn on the windows, but still the light was
staggering. George squinted until his eyes became accustomed to the
brightness. Then he focused them on various items in the room.</p>

<p>He had just flipped the sheets back from his body and was commenting
proudly to himself, "I'm more of a man than I thought," when the door
opened.</p>

<p>George looked up, startled.</p>

<p>The most beautiful woman he had ever seen was in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Hi," she said, her voice as soft and vibrant as ever.</p>

<p>"Karen!"</p>

<p>She was staring, unashamed, at the body George had just fully
uncovered. "Wow!" she said.</p>

<p>George scrabbled for the sheets, pulled them over him.</p>

<p>"You should knock," he said, starting to laugh.</p>

<p>She came over to the foot of the bed, and slowly turned around for him.
"Well, how about me? Are you disappointed?" Her voice had an intimate,
challenging quality.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," he said slowly, looking at her for what it seemed to
George was the first time, "you are lovely. You're more than I ever
dreamed. And I don't care what you say or think of me for saying this,
but I love you. I've loved you since I first heard your voice. I know
it's impossible&mdash;no woman could ever knowingly fall in love with me&mdash;a
freak, a brain in a bottle&mdash;but that can't stop me from loving you.
Maybe it's just that I'm so happy to have a body again after so long
that makes me say this...."</p>

<p>She had come around the corner of the bed, and was sitting on the edge
of it now. There were tears in her eyes and her hands were clasped over
his. "I know, George," she said slowly, when he had stopped. "I felt
the same way as you&mdash;when I got my new body&mdash;but I didn't have anyone
to say it to."</p>

<p>His eyes widened in disbelief. His mouth worked for several seconds
before the words would come. "You...."</p>

<p>She nodded slowly. "George, don't you remember many months ago&mdash;the
night of your accident on the El ... there was a girl on the train with
you...."</p>

<p>He stared at her, sudden amazement in his eyes. "Of course I
remember&mdash;but&mdash;you&mdash;you mean <i>you are</i>...."</p>

<p>"Yes, George. I'm the same girl&mdash;different body, of course. My case
wasn't as tough as yours. Your brain was close to death for quite
awhile before you regained conscious thought."</p>

<p>He looked at her incredulously. "But you said <i>I</i> was the first to ever
go this far...."</p>

<p>Her face was close to his, her lips smiling. "I said you were the first
<i>man</i> to pull through. I was praying for you George. I needed you&mdash;as
much as you thought you needed me...."</p>

<p>As his arms closed about her, there wasn't much else for either to
say....</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
